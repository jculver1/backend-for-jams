Farmers-Mark-It App (backend), to see the frontend  visit: https://github.com/Mstapleton22/farmers-markit-frontend

Goals of this app are to allow the user to locate businesses at Denver farmers markets. 
The user is able to search by ingredient or by the name of the business. 

Future goals:

Right now, we used fake data, with the intentions to have businesses submit their data in the future. 
Make a route that shows a nested view of the market, business, and a list of their full menu. 
Use Google Maps API so the user can see locations near them.
